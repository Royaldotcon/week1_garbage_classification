    "# Garbage Classification with EfficientNetV2B2\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "> In this project, we aim to design and implement an advanced garbage classification system using the EfficientNetV2B2 deep learning architecture. The core objective is to automate the process of waste segregation by accurately categorizing different types of garbage (such as plastic, organic, metal, paper, and glass) through image-based classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging a carefully curated dataset, our model is trained to recognize and differentiate waste categories, laying the groundwork for scalable and efficient waste management systems. By integrating the computational efficiency and high accuracy of the EfficientNetV2B2 model, this solution aspires to assist in streamlining recycling processes, reducing human intervention, and minimizing environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the system aligns with global sustainability goals by promoting cleaner waste disposal practices, reducing landfill overflow, and fostering smarter urban waste management initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To develop an accurate and efficient garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning for automated waste sorting.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Challenges and Scope\n",
    "**Key Challenge:** A notable challenge encountered is the inherent **class imbalance** within the dataset.\n",

    "    Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a different but related task. It also allows us to build accurate models in a time-saving way by starting from patterns learned when solving a different problem. This approach is beneficial when there is limited data for the new task, as the pre-trained model already has learned features that can be adapted. Transfer learning can significantly improve models' performance and efficiency in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "-  **Reduces training time** — you don't start from scratch.\n",
    "-  **Leverages learned features** from large datasets (like ImageNet).\n",
    "-  **Improves performance**, especially with limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Load a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).\n",
    "2.  **Freeze** the pretrained layers (optional).\n",
    "3.  Add new layers for your custom task.\n",
    "4.  Train on your new dataset (can also fine-tune).\n",
    "## EfficientNetV2B2: Transfer Learning Backbone\n",
